As a final-year Computer Science (Hons) undergraduate, I am highly motivated to build a career in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, with a strong interest in designing intelligent, data-driven systems that solve real-world problems.

I have hands-on experience working with Python and SQL for data analysis, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, as well as building and evaluating machine learning models using libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights and developing predictive solutions that support informed decision-making.

I am also familiar with cloud platforms including AWS and Microsoft Azure, and I am actively learning how to deploy and manage scalable AI/ML solutions in cloud environments. My academic and project experience has strengthened my understanding of data pipelines, model optimization, and efficient data processing workflows.

I am particularly passionate about:

Applied Machine Learning & AI

Data Analysis and Visualization

Currently, I am seeking a Data Science Intern or AI Engineer Intern position where I can apply my technical skills, collaborate with experienced professionals, and contribute to impactful, real-world projects while continuing to grow in the fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Technical Skills

Programming: Python, SQL, Java

Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras

Cloud: AWS, Microsoft Azure

Databases: MySQL, MongoDB

Tools: GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code

I’m always open to connecting with professionals in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI, and discussing internship opportunities, projects, or emerging technologies in this space.
